<h1>The best movies according Adrian's opinion</h1>
<h2>Here's the top 3</h2>

<h4>There are some spoilers, so watch out!</h4>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
    This is propably is biased because how recently i've watch the movie, but, it was a GREAT movie, the feeling that you are collecting
    pieces of a puzzle but you dont actually know that is a puzzle right away, in the first like 40 minutes i was flabbergastered
    on seeing some familiar faces like Niels Bohr, hearing concepts that i have some interest helped to not lose my sanity as well (jk i was like a kid all the time with a grin in my face).
</p>

<p>
    Although that, the moment when the Gen. Leslie presents to Oppie the project, the movie becomes a only up rollercoaster, with some
    emocional turns, yes, but all comes down in the moment of truth, the trinity test, my god is one experience that i would love to feel again.

<p>
    In the same way, there are some scences that are equally powerfull, so i'm leaving the doubt on you to go and watch it by yourself, so go on!

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>
    On the other side of the spectrum, we have that marvellous film made by Edgar Wright, that if you are some serious cinema critic maybe you would expect more
    but as a normal person, the feeling on the music, how baby flows around it is like watching myself enjoying music, and as a music lover.
    is something that generates something on me, it was like magic.

<h3>Harry Potter: The prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>
    This is like my childhood movie, i love harry potter with passion, so seeing the most "potter" movie out there, is gonna catch me intuitively
    i really love this movie with my whole heart, its a great movie, but go and wacht it, and when you come back, leave a coment, i would love to see it.
